    Kas's Data Communcation Review of Doom.
\end{center}


\begin{enumerate}
    \item What are the major components of DC?\\
          The message, senders, recievers, transmission medium, and protocol.

    \item Describe what each one is.\\
          Message: Information to be delievered.\\
          Senders: devices that transmits the data messages.\\
          Receivers: Devices that recieve the data messages.\\
          Transmission Medium: Physical link that carries the data.\\
          protocol: Set of rules that govern the Data communcation.\\

    \item What are the three different types of data flows between devices?\\
          Simplex: One way communcation.\\
          Half Duplex: Bidirectional on one link.\\
          Full Duplex: Bidirectional on two links.\\

    \item What are the purposes of a network?\\
          Distributing processing.\\
          Sharing data vs centralization: shared access of data-banks among computers.\\
          Security (not to be intruded) and robustness (not easy to break).\\

          Distributed computers approach is for more security and reliability dependability.\\

    \item Give a network criteria.\\
          Performance: Response time. Packet throughput and delay.\\

          Reliability: How often the networks fail.\\

          Security: Privacy, integrity, and authentication of Communcation data. Recovery from breaches and data loss.\\

    \item T/F Is source destination delay dynamic?\\
          True.

    \item Give a physical structure of a connection.\\
          Point to point: Dedicated link to be utilized only by end devices.\\

          Multipoint: Many end devices share the link capacity.\\



    \item Explain two network topologies.\\

          Mesh(Complete): Each devices has a dedicated point-to-point link to other devices.\\

          Star: Devices are connected point to point to a central hub (Controller exchanger).\\

          Bus: Multipoint link as a backbone for a network where devices have drop line to tap into bus.\\

          Ring: Each station connects point to point with only two other stations. Stations are connected via repeater.\\

          Hybrid: A combiation of different strategies.\\

          Pizza: A Star inside a Ring. Effectively forming a pizza.\\

    \item Give a pro and a con for each of the previously described topologies.\\
          Mesh\\
          Pro: Fast communcation, Robost and privacy. Easy to fault detect and isolate.\\
          Con: Cabling size, fan-out ports, \textbf{scalability} and cost.\\

          Star\\
          Pro: Less links and ports per node, two hops delay only -- source to hub and hub destination delays. Cost of installation/operation and easyt o maintain when
          nodes added or dropped.\\
          Con: Not so robust (center of control is vunerable),  a lot more physical cables than a bus.\\

          Bus\\
          Pro: Less cabling one hop (source-destination) delay\\
          Con:Scalability is limited and cable length depdent, which limit the number of nodes due to power loss with distance, not so robost, difficult fault isolation and collisions.\\

          Ring\\
          Pro: Easy installation, better fault isolation (dead node will be shorted and the ring is okay), and robustness.\\
          Con: n/2 hops communication delay on averagbe, vulnerable to cuts. Broadcast network (no privacy)\\

          Hybrid\\
          Pro: Better domain seperation and one hope delay.\\
          Con: Better robustness than the star but still vulnerable hub\\

          Pizza\\
          Pro: Better robustness (It's a ring system and a star combined.), low cost, 1 hop to neboring nodes or 2 to other nodes\\
          Con: Cost of adding more cabling.\\


    \item What are the categories of Networks?\\
          Local area networks (LAN), Wide Area Networks (WAN), Metropolitatan area networks (MAN)\\

    \item T/F the internet is a collation of Lans and Mans.\\
          False it is also a collection of Wans.\\

    \item What are the elements of a protocal.\\
          Syntax, semantics, and timing.\\

    \item What are the types of Standards and an example of each.\\
          Defacto: Not approved but widely used TCP/IP.\\
          De Jure: Approved by a recongized body: ISOOSI, IEEE.\\

    \item are the two parts of Network architecture?\\
          Hardware and Software.\\
          Hardware is at the core of any network while softwate is to derive the core HW to communicate to end users.

    \item What are the subtasks of a software model called?
          A layer.\\

    \item What is a protocol Data Unit (PDU)\\
          it is passed to the layer beneath which in turns ads a header before assigning it to the next layer (par the physical layer.).
